This phenomenon is called subliminal affective priming. The present study was conducted to replicate and expand previous findings by investigating interaction of primes and targets in the affective priming effect. Two conditions were used, Prime (subliminal presentation 35 msec.) of an angry face of a woman and a No Prime control condition. Just after presentation of the prime, an ambiguous angry face or an emotionally neutral face was presented above the threshold of awareness (500 msec.). 12 female undergraduate women judged categories of facial expressions (Anger, Neutral, or Happiness) for the target faces. Analysis indicated that the Anger primes significantly facilitated judgment of anger for the ambiguous angry faces; however, the priming effect of the Anger primes was not observed for neutral faces. Consequently, the present finding suggested that a subliminal affective priming effect should be more prominent when affective valence of primes and targets is congruent. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2466\/pms.2003.96.2.695","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,8,31]],"date-time":"2011-08-31T15:55:39Z","timestamp":1314806139000},"page":"695-702","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":"Interaction of Prime and Target in the Subliminal Affective Priming Effect","prefix":"10.1177","volume":"96","author":[{"given":"Kaoruko","family":"Haneda","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Nagoya University"}]},{"given":"Michio","family":"Nomura","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Nagoya University"}]},{"given":"Tetsuya","family":"Iidaka","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Nagoya University"}]},{"given":"Hideki","family":"Ohira","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Nagoya University"}]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,31]]},"reference":[{"key":"bibr1-pms.2003.96.2.695","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/02699930126251"},{"key":"bibr2-pms.2003.96.2.695","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/01461672002611001"},{"key":"bibr3-pms.2003.96.2.695","first-page":"242","volume-title":"Cognitive neuroscience of emotion","author":"Bradley M.

An attempt is made to account for the hiatus between interest in education by sociologists on the one hand and on the other, their contribution to a sociology of education of value to the teaching profession. It is argued that both normative and interpretive approaches must be presented in sociology courses for prospective teachers. Only in this way can the contradictions and dilemmas in contemporary sociology, reflecting as it does the problems of modern society, be made explicit. Teacher trainees must be educated for the lifetime task of reflection on the meaning of their work; this is seen as the most significant role of sociology in the training of teachers. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/000494417602000306","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,7]],"date-time":"2013-03-07T14:13:22Z","timestamp":1362665602000},"page":"292-305","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":"The Role of Sociology in Teacher Education","prefix":"10.1177","volume":"20","author":[{"given":"Patricia","family":"Daine","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lois","family":"Foster","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,22]]},"reference":[{"key":"bibr1-000494417602000306","volume-title":"Knowledge and Control","author":"Young M.

Exercise can slow gastric emptying rates, moderating postprandial lipaemia. The purpose of this study was to determine if moderate exercise, prior to fat ingestion, influences gastrointestinal transit, lipaemia, oxidative stress and arterial wall function. Eight apparently healthy males (age 23.6 \u00b1 2.8 yrs; height 181.4 \u00b1 8.1 cm; weight 83.4 \u00b1 16.2 kg; all data mean \u00b1 SD) participated in the randomised, crossover design, where (i) subjects ingested a high-fat meal alone (control), and (ii) ingested a high-fat meal, preceded by 1 h of moderate exercise. Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) was examined at baseline, post-exercise, and in the postprandial period. Gastric emptying was measured using the <jats:sup>13<\/jats:sup>C-octanoic acid breath test. Measures of venous blood were obtained prior to and following exercise and at 2, 4 and 6 hours post-ingestion. PWV increased (6.5 \u00b1 1.9 m\/sec) at 2 (8.9 \u00b1 1.7 m\/sec) and 4 hrs (9.0 \u00b1 1.6 m\/sec) post-ingestion in the control group (time \u00d7 group interaction, P &lt; 0.05). PWV was increased at 2 hrs post-ingestion in the control compared to the exercise trial; 8.9 \u00b1 1.7 vs. 6.2 \u00b1 1.5 m\/sec (time \u00d7 group interaction, P &lt; 0.05). Lipid hydroperoxides increased over time (pooled exercise and control data, P &lt; 0.05). Serum triacylglycerols were elevated postprandially (pooled exercise and control data, P &lt; 0.05). There were no changes in gastric emptying, cholesterol, or C-reactive protein levels. These data suggest that acute exercise prior to the consumption of a high-fat meal has the potential to reduce vascular impairments.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1186\/1476-511x-6-30","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2007,10,31]],"date-time":"2007-10-31T19:13:50Z","timestamp":1193858030000},"update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":36,"title":"Exercise and postprandial lipaemia: effects on peripheral vascular function, oxidative stress and gastrointestinal transit","prefix":"10.1186","volume":"6","author":[{"given":"Miriam","family":"Clegg","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Conor","family":"McClean","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"W.

The protracted domestication process finished around 6,500\u20136,000\u00a0years ago in China and about two millennia later in India, when hybridization with Chinese rice took place. Subsequently farming populations grew and expanded by migration and incorporation of pre-existing populations. These expansions can be linked to hypothetical language family dispersal models, including dispersal from China southwards by the Sino-Tibetan and Austronesian groups. In South Asia much dispersal of rice took place after Indo-Aryan and Dravidian speakers adopted rice from speakers of lost languages of northern India.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007\/s12284-011-9078-7","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,3]],"date-time":"2012-01-03T12:42:03Z","timestamp":1325594523000},"page":"78-92","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":149,"title":"Pathways to Asian Civilizations: Tracing the Origins and Spread of Rice and Rice Cultures","prefix":"10.1186","volume":"4","author":[{"given":"Dorian Q.","family":"Fuller","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,4]]},"reference":[{"issue":"2","key":"9078_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"89","DOI":"10.1007\/s12520-010-0029-9","volume":"2","author":"S Ahn","year":"2010","unstructured":"Ahn S.

Pergeseran dari ketergantungan pada sistem berpendingin kipas menjadi ke skema pendinginan yang memanfaatkan pendingin cairan dielektrik menggunakan berbagai skema pendinginan fase tunggal. Perekayasa (engineer) sistem pendingin memusatkan perhatian pada skema pendinginan dua fase, untuk memanfaatkan kedua system pendingin. Sifat yang harus dimiliki perekayasa sistem pendingin ini yaitu konveksi fluida dan panas laten untuk memindahkan jumlah kalor yang jauh lebih besar dari pada skema fase tunggal, sambil mempertahankan suhu perangkat yang lebih rendah. Beberapa skema pendingin cairan dua fase telah direkomendasikan untuk menghilangkan fluks kalor tinggi dari perangkat yang digunakan diaplikasi. Momentum droplet memungkinkan cairan menembus penghalang uap yang dibuat oleh gelembung nukleasi dan secara lebih efektif mengisi kembali permukaan, keduanya sangat bermanfaat untuk pendinginan fluks tinggi. Pada model dan simulasi pengembangan droplet menggunakan metode LBM multi fase, parameter penting yang selalu didapatkan adalah arus semu maksimum (maximum spurious currents) yang menetukan stabilitas komputasi.&#x0D;\nKata kunci : Modeling Matematis, Simulasi Droplet, Metode Latice-Boltzman&#x0D;\n\u00a0&#x0D;\nAbstract: The need for innovative cooling schemes for maintaining electronic devices with safe temperatures below predetermined limits by material limitations and reliability constraints associated with aggressive microchip miniaturization of electronic components. Shifting from reliance on fan-cooled systems to cooling schemes that utilize dielectric liquid cooling using a variety of single-phase cooling schemes. The cooling system engineer focuses on two-phase cooling schemes, to take advantage of both cooling systems. Properties that these cooling system engineers must possess are fluid convection and latent heat to transfer a much greater amount of heat than a single-phase scheme, while maintaining a lower device temperature. Several two-phase liquid cooling schemes have been recommended to remove the high heat flux from the apparatus used in the application. The droplet momentum allows the liquid to penetrate the vapor barrier created by the nucleation bubbles and more effectively replenish the surface, both of which are very beneficial for high flux cooling. In droplet development models and simulations using the multi-phase LBM method, an important parameter that is always obtained is the maximum spurious currents which determine the computational stability.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Mathematical Modeling, Droplet Simulation, Latice-Boltzman Method&#x0D;\n\u00a0<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.51401\/jinteks.v3i3.1039","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,29]],"date-time":"2021-08-29T02:45:58Z","timestamp":1630205158000},"page":"389-393","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"MODELING MATEMATIS DAN SIMULASI DROPLET UNTUK PENDINGINAN ALAT-ALAT TEKNOLOGI INFORMASI DAN KOMPUTER DENGAN METODE LATTICE-BOLTZMANN","prefix":"10.51401","volume":"3","author":[{"family":"Wiji Nurastuti","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kumara","family":"Ari Yuana","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"28741","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,29]]},"container-title":"Jurnal Informatika Teknologi dan Sains","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"http:\/\/www.jurnal.uts.ac.id\/index.php\/JINTEKS\/article\/download\/1039\/754","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http:\/\/www.jurnal.uts.ac.id\/index.php\/JINTEKS\/article\/download\/1039\/754","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,29]],"date-time":"2021-08-29T02:45:58Z","timestamp":1630205158000},"score":1,"subtitle":["MODELING MATEMATIS DAN SIMULASI DROPLET UNTUK PENDINGINAN ALAT-ALAT TEKNOLOGI INFORMASI DAN KOMPUTER DENGAN METODE LATTICE-BOLTZMANN"],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,29]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,29]]}},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.51401\/jinteks.v3i3.1039","relation":{},"ISSN":["2686-3359"],"container-title-short":"JINTEKS","published":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,29]]}}

Metodologia: Trata-se de uma pesquisa transversal, descritiva, de car\u00e1ter quantitativo, classificada como epidemiol\u00f3gica retrospectiva temporal. Foram estudados todos os casos notificados de epilepsia, com idade inferior a 19 anos, no estado do Tocantins correlacionado com as demais vari\u00e1veis no per\u00edodo de 2007 a 2017, atrav\u00e9s do acesso ao DATASUS. Resultado: Os dados analisados apresentaram um aumento do n\u00famero de \u00f3bitos, por\u00e9m n\u00e3o proporcional conforme a idade. Com maiores n\u00fameros de \u00f3bitos entre 1 a 4 anos e 15 a 19 anos. O n\u00famero de interna\u00e7\u00f5es aumentou durante o per\u00edodo analisado, com maior n\u00famero dos casos em pacientes do sexo masculino entre 1 a 4 anos. Discuss\u00e3o: Observou uma discord\u00e2ncia da literatura conforme o aumento do n\u00famero de casos de interna\u00e7\u00e3o e \u00f3bitos. Obteve-se maior n\u00famero de casos de interna\u00e7\u00e3o e \u00f3bitos no sexo masculino.
