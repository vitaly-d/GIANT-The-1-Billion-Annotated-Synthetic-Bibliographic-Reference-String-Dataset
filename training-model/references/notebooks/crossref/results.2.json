In legal texts words have<jats:italic> <\/jats:italic>legal connotations and legal consequences, which enable either to protect the interests of legal entities and<jats:italic> <\/jats:italic>individuals, or, on the contrary, violate their rights. Inappropriate translations of legal texts cause misunderstanding and vagueness, which is unacceptable in this type of texts. The compendium of legal texts<jats:italic> <\/jats:italic>in Iran is based on general legal law and jurisprudential principles. The lack of bilingual legal RussianPersian and Persian-Russian dictionaries enhances the translation problems in this field. This fact suggests<jats:italic> <\/jats:italic>that due attention has not been paid to such an important issue in the field of linguistics. The current criterion used in the translation of legal documents is the objective interpretation of the text. The identification<jats:italic> <\/jats:italic>of the problem can help solve it. The subject of this article was the legal content focused on legal family<jats:italic> <\/jats:italic>and financial texts. The purpose of our research is to reveal the difficulties translators of legal texts in these<jats:italic> <\/jats:italic>languages face, to study the best examples of translation accumulated by far and to help translators of legal<jats:italic> <\/jats:italic>texts by integrating translators\u2019 experiences and publishing comparative works that reveal cultural and<jats:italic> <\/jats:italic>semantic connotations in two languages.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.24833\/2410-2423-2021-1-25-111-118","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,5]],"date-time":"2021-04-05T09:43:16Z","timestamp":1617615796000},"page":"111-118","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Comparing Translation Peculiarities of Legal Texts in The Russian and Persian Languages","prefix":"10.24833","volume":"7","author":[{"given":"V.","family":"Rezvani","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Sheikhbahayi Square st.

Here, we report a new tool for displaying large and diverse genomic data along chromosomes. The software is implemented in R so that visualization can be easily integrated with its numerous packages for processing genomic data. It supports simultaneous visualization of multiple tracks of data. Large genomic regions such as QTLs or synteny tracts may be shown along histograms of number of genes, genetic variants, or any other type of genomic element. Tracks can also contain values for continuous or categorical variables and the user can choose among points, connected lines, colored segments, or histograms for representing data. chromPlot takes data from tables in data.frame in GRanges formats. The information necessary to draw chromosomes for mouse and human is included with the package. For other organisms, chromPlot can read Gap and cytoBandIdeo tables from the UCSC Genome Browser.

EMTs undergoing routine training took part in a simulation using mannequins. Parameters including compression depth, total number and rate of compressions; occurrence of incorrect hand position and incomplete chest recoil were collected over 16 2-min cycles of CPR (32\u2009min total), with EMTs working in pairs. <\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Result<\/jats:title><jats:p> The simulation study included 43 EMTs. The median duration of on-scene CPR was 3.7\u2009min. Fear of decrease in performance was the main obstacle to continued CPR ( n\u2009=\u2009188\/254 [74.0%]). Standards for high-quality CPR were met at each of the 16 steps of the simulation. Compression rate increased significantly with time. There were no significant changes in any other parameter. <\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion<\/jats:title><jats:p> Pairs of EMTs maintained high-quality CPR for 16 cycles (32\u2009min) with no decrease in performance.

METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ten AUV patients in the acute phase and from ten controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these two groups were screened using microarray analysis with the cut-off criteria (|fold changes|\u200a&gt;\u200a1.5 and p-value\u200a&lt;\u200a0.05). Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes) database. RESULTS: There were 57 DEGs (50 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated) identified in the AUV group. Functional enrichment analysis showed that most of the up-regulated DEGs were significantly enriched in terms related to the neutrophil-mediated immune pathway. From the PPI network, the top ten hub genes were extracted by calculating four topological properties, and most of them were related to the innate immune system, inflammatory processes and vascular disorders. The complete blood count tests showed that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly higher in the 72 AUV patients than in the age-matched controls (2.93\u00b12.25 vs 1.54\u00b10.61, p\u200a&lt;\u200a0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the neutrophil-mediated immune pathway may contribute to the development of AUV by mediating inflammatory and thrombotic changes in the vestibular organ.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3233\/ves-200044","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,1]],"date-time":"2020-12-01T21:50:59Z","timestamp":1606859459000},"page":"363-374","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":"Neutrophil-mediated

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and lethal primary brain tumor in adults. Here we show that GBP5 was highly expressed in GBM cell lines and in clinical samples, especially in the mesenchymal subtype. The expression levels of GBP5 were negatively correlated with the prognosis of GBM patients. Overexpression of GBP5 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, silencing GBP5 by RNA interference exhibited the opposite effects. Consequently, targeting GBP5 in GBM cells resulted in impaired tumor growth and prolonged survival time of mice with GBM tumors. We further identified that the Src\/ERK1\/2\/MMP3 axis was essential for GBP5-promoted GBM aggressiveness. These findings suggest that GBP5 may represent a novel target for GBM intervention.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038\/s41419-021-03492-3","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,20]],"date-time":"2021-02-20T15:51:44Z","timestamp":1613836304000},"update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":"GBP5 drives malignancy of glioblastoma via the Src\/ERK1\/2\/MMP3 pathway","prefix":"10.1038","volume":"12","author":[{"given":"Xiaoting","family":"Yu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jing","family":"Jin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yanwen","family":"Zheng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hua","family":"Zhu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hui","family":"Xu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jun","family":"Ma","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Qing","family":"Lan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Zhixiang","family":"Zhuang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Clark C.","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2540-1738","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ming","family":"Li","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,19]]},"reference":[{"key":"3492_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"2683","DOI":"10.1101\/gad.1596707","volume":"21","author":"FB Furnari","year":"2007","unstructured":"Furnari, F.

However, 3DP fiber-reinforced composite structures suffer from low fiber content compared to the traditional composite, such as 3D orthogonal woven preforms solidified with vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) that impedes their high-performance applications such as in aerospace, automobile, marine and building industries. The present research included fabrication of 3DP fiberglass-reinforced nylon composites, with maximum possible fiber content dictated by the current 3D printing technology at varying fiber orientations (such as 0\/0, 0\/90, \u00b145 and 0\/45\/90\/\u221245) and characterizing their microstructural and performance properties, such as tensile and impact resistance (Drop-weight, Izod and Charpy). Results indicated that fiber orientation with maximum fiber content have tremendous effect on the improvement of the performance of the 3DP composites, even though they inherently contain structural defects in terms of voids resulting in premature failure of the composites. Benchmarking the results with VARTM 3D orthogonal woven (3DOW) composites revealed that 3DP composites had slightly lower tensile strength due to poor matrix infusion and voids between adjacent fiber layers\/raster, and delamination due to lack of through-thickness reinforcement, but excellent impact strength (224% more strong) due to favorable effect of structural voids and having a laminated structure developed in layer-by-layer fashion.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/jcs5050136","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,18]],"date-time":"2021-05-18T16:17:16Z","timestamp":1621354636000},"page":"136","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Maximizing the Performance of 3D Printed Fiber-Reinforced Composites","prefix":"10.3390","volume":"5","author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9354-2022","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"S M Fijul","family":"Kabir","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kavita","family":"Mathur","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Abdel-Fattah M.","family":"Seyam","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1968","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,18]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compstruct.2019.111476"},{"key":"ref2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compstruct.2020.112562"},{"key":"ref3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3390\/technologies8040051"},{"key":"ref4","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.addma.2017.06.004"},{"key":"ref5","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/0731684420963217"},{"key":"ref6","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.addma.2019.01.005"},{"key":"ref7","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compositesa.2015.11.042"},{"key":"ref8"},{"key":"ref9","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1038\/srep23058"},{"key":"ref10","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compstruct.2018.03.051"},{"key":"ref11","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.addma.2018.05.007"},{"key":"ref12","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.polymertesting.2018.04.038"},{"key":"ref13","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compositesb.2018.04.054"},{"key":"ref14"},{"key":"ref15","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.polymertesting.2005.03.011"},{"key":"ref16","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/00405000.2020.1778223"},{"key":"ref17","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/00405000.2020.1863567"},{"key":"ref18","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1089\/3dp.2018.0060"},{"key":"ref19","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.matdes.2017.10.021"},{"key":"ref20","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3390\/jcs4030098"},{"key":"ref21","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.addma.2018.04.039"},{"key":"ref22","series-title":"Effects of Fiber Surface Treatment and Nozzle Geometry in Structural Properties of Additively Manufactured Two-Phase Composite","first-page":"0407","author":"Papon","year":"2019"},{"key":"ref23","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.addma.2018.01.002"},{"key":"ref24","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1002\/admt.201800271"},{"key":"ref25","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/0021998318781938"},{"key":"ref26","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compscitech.2018.12.021"},{"key":"ref27","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/09243046.2019.1650323"},{"key":"ref28","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/00405000.2018.1481722"},{"key":"ref29","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jmst.2016.04.011"},{"key":"ref30","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/0021998318772152"},{"key":"ref31","first-page":"299","article-title":"Tensile, Compressive and shear properties of unidirectional glass\/epoxy composites subjected to mechanical loading and low temperature services","volume":"20","author":"Torabizadeh","year":"2013","journal-title":"Indian J.

Urine biomarkers and SCr were measured in thirty late preterm infants on days one, two, five, and seven postnatal. Urine biomarkers included neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), Tamm\u2013Horsfall glycoprotein (THP), and liver fatty-acid-binding protein (L-FABP). Gestational age was positively correlated with SCr levels at birth, but inversely correlated with SCr levels at day five and day seven. Eighteen (60%) infants had stage 1 AKI, and twenty (67%) infants were treated with AGs. Infants with AKI had lower gestational age and lower birth weight than those without AKI. Urinary biomarkers adjusted according to uCr levels in infants with AKI were not statistically different from those in infants without AKI. There were no significant differences in incidence of AKI, and SCr levels during and after cessation of AG treatment. The uMCP-1\/Cr ratio at days five and seven was higher in infants treated with AG than in non-treated infants.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/children8100896","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,11]],"date-time":"2021-10-11T01:19:32Z","timestamp":1633915172000},"page":"896","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Longitudinal Changes in Serum Creatinine Levels and Urinary Biomarkers in Late Preterm Infants during the First Postnatal Week: Association with Acute Kidney Injury and Treatment with Aminoglycoside","prefix":"10.3390","volume":"8","author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2595-505X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sang-Yoon","family":"Lee","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9786-7898","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jung-Eun","family":"Moon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4782-1127","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sook-Hyun","family":"Park","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1968","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,9]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1038\/nrneph.2012.38"},{"key":"ref2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s00467-014-2837-0"},{"key":"ref3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s00467-009-1133-x"},{"key":"ref4","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.2215\/CJN.00860114"},{"key":"ref5","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1093\/ndt\/gfr477"},{"key":"ref6","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1203\/PDR.0b013e31820b95ca"},{"key":"ref7","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0043809"},{"key":"ref8","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s00467-008-1060-2"},{"key":"ref9","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1136\/adc.2005.092023"},{"key":"ref10","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1136\/adc.2004.060434"},{"key":"ref11","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3109\/14767058.2016.1171311"},{"key":"ref12","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3109\/14767058.2010.510646"},{"key":"ref13","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s10024-003-3029-2"},{"key":"ref14","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1681\/ASN.2010121266"},{"key":"ref15","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1038\/s41598-020-60890-x"},{"key":"ref16","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1038\/pr.2016.70"},{"key":"ref17","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s00467-013-2421-z"},{"key":"ref18","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s00467-015-3129-z"},{"key":"ref19","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s11255-017-1781-x"},{"key":"ref20","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1159\/000339789"},{"key":"ref21","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s00134-003-2078-3"},{"key":"ref22","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1038\/s41390-018-0249-8"},{"key":"ref23","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/apa.13508"},{"key":"ref24","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1203\/PDR.0b013e3181baa3dd"},{"key":"ref25","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s00467-014-2989-y"},{"key":"ref26","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1530\/acta.0.1050425"},{"key":"ref27","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1203\/00006450-198505000-00004"},{"key":"ref28","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s00467-016-3327-3"},{"key":"ref29","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jpeds.2012.02.007"},{"key":"ref30"},{"key":"ref31","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1093\/ndt\/gft510"},{"key":"ref32","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1155\/2014\/568738"},{"key":"ref33","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1046\/j.1523-1755.1998.00966.x"},{"key":"ref34","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1542\/peds.103.4.e49"},{"key":"ref35","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s004670000356"},{"key":"ref36","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1542\/peds.104.6.e76"},{"key":"ref37","first-page":"1070","article-title":"Nephrotoxic Medications and Associated Acute Kidney Injury in Very Low Birth Weight Infants","volume":"4","author":"Barhight","year":"2017","journal-title":"J.

In the past, much attention has focused on the impact of technology-related privacy concerns from a transactional perspective. However, privacy concerns regarding communication monitoring are now emerging as a significant issue with the potential to negatively impact both productivity and morale within the computer-mediated work environment. This chapter outlines the evolution of technology-related privacy concerns. The lack of definitional consensus and the resulting conceptual and operational confusion that surrounds the privacy construct is described. Furthermore, the significant deficit of rigorous academic studies on this topic is highlighted. The current state of privacy legislation in Europe is addressed and some of the key challenges that face researchers who may wish to conduct research on this phenomenon are outlined.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018\/978-1-60566-222-0.ch012","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2010,5,19]],"date-time":"2010-05-19T20:24:16Z","timestamp":1274300656000},"page":"208-220","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Technology-Related Privacy Concerns","prefix":"10.4018","author":[{"given":"Cliona","family":"McParland","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Dublin City University, Ireland"}]},{"given":"Regina","family":"Connolly","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Dublin City University, Ireland"}]}],"member":"2432","container-title":"Emerging Topics and Technologies in Information Systems","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.igi-global.com\/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=10199","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,15]],"date-time":"2021-09-15T21:21:45Z","timestamp":1631740905000},"score":1,"subtitle":["An Emerging Challenge"],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4018\/978-1-60566-222-0.ch012","relation":{},"published":{"date-parts":[[2009]]}}

From the simulation results of a unit cell composed of two stacked arrays of Minkowski and square patch showed that, 415\u00b0 reflection phase range is achieved and lower insertion loss which is lower than 0.9 dB. Base on the simulated reflection phase coefficient, a dual layer microstrip reflectarray antenna with Minkowski and square radiating shape elements have been design and model using commercially available computer models of CST Microwave Studio.

It can replicate in all warm-blooded animals in which it causes a devastating neurological illness, which almost invariably results in death. Rabies is a disease of animals and human infection is a \u2018spillover\u2019 event occurring most commonly following a bite from an infected dog. Infection is seen in different patterns; rabies with little or no wildlife involvement, sometimes known as urban or street rabies, or in the wildlife population with spillover into domesticated animals (sylvatic).<\/p><p>Eleven distinct species of lyssavirus are now recognized: species 1 is the most common strain found predominately in terrestrial animals. Species 2-7 are found in bat species with the exception of Mokola virus (species 4). Despite the availability of effective vaccines significant mortality still occurs, mostly in the tropics. The majority of rabies free countries are islands which are able to remain rabies free by import controls. Effective animal vaccines are available and dog rabies is well controlled in most parts of the developed world with dog vaccination. However, it remains an intractable problem in many countries in Asia and Africa due to lack of infrastructure, cost of vaccines and difficulty to control dog population. In recent years progress in controlling wildlife rabies has been achieved in west Europe using vaccine in bait, which offers promise for other regions with complex epidemiology.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/med\/9780198570028.003.0042","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,9]],"date-time":"2012-01-09T05:49:32Z","timestamp":1326088172000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":"Rabies and rabies-related lyssaviruses","prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Ashley C.","family":"Banyard","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Anthony R.","family":"Fooks","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"286","container-title":"Oxford Medicine Online","original-title":["Rabies and rabies-related lyssaviruses"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,7]],"date-time":"2017-11-07T13:48:09Z","timestamp":1510062489000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/med\/9780198570028.003.0042","relation":{},"published":{"date-parts":[[2011,7]]}}
