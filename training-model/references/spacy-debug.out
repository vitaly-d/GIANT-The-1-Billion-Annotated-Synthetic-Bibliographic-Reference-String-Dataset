✔ No overlap between training and evaluation data

============================== Vocab & Vectors ==============================
ℹ 22259451 total word(s) in the data (1550048 unique)
ℹ No word vectors present in the package

============================ Span Categorization ============================

Spans Key   Labels
---------   -------
sc          {'bib'}

⚠ No examples for texts WITHOUT new label 'bib'
ℹ Span characteristics for spans_key 'sc'
ℹ SD = Span Distinctiveness, BD = Boundary Distinctiveness

Span Type      Length   SD     BD
------------   ------   ----   ----
bib            1.0      2.26   1.16
------------   ------   ----   ----
Wgt. Average   1.0      2.26   1.16

ℹ Over 90% of spans have lengths of 1 -- 1 (min=1, max=1). The most
common span lengths are: 1 (100.0%). If you are using the n-gram suggester, note
that omitting infrequent n-gram lengths can greatly improve speed and memory
usage.
✔ Spans are distinct from the rest of the corpus
✔ Boundary tokens are distinct from the rest of the corpus
✔ Good amount of examples for all labels

========================== Named Entity Recognition ==========================
